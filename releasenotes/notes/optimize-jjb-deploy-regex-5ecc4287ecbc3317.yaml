    The JJB Deploy Job is configured to trigger only if the Gerrit comment
    starts with the `jjb-deploy` keyword.

    Without the regex being optimized the job triggers on any occurance
    of the `jjb-deploy` keyword in a Gerrit comment, with is waste infra
    resources.

    Example of a valid command in Gerrit comment that triggers the job:

    ``jjb-deploy builder-jjb-*``

    Example of a invalid command in Gerrit comment that would _not_ trigger
    the job:

    ``Update the job. jjb-deploy builder-jjb-*``
