    Use choosing strategy Gerrit Trigger in container/jar and
    package cloud release merge jobs. This retains the current
    behavior in the simple merge case, and ensures that a job
    triggered by a "remerge" comment uses the release file at
    that commit.  The previous choosing strategy, default, uses
    the tip of the target branch.  That does not allow recovery
    from merge job failure if the target branch has advanced past
    the commit with the release file.
