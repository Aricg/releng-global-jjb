    Change compare-type to REG_EXP in macros lf_python_clm_xc and
    lf_pypi_common for config parameter gerrit_trigger_file_paths
    with the regular expression .*
    Previously was ANT, which didn't match anything with pattern .*
    so recheck/reverify comment triggers did not work.
    Clarify documentation of comment triggers for python jobs.
