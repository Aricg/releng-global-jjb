    Revise python-tools-install.sh to drop creation of virtualenv
    in ~/.local.  That is NOT a Python virtualenv and should not be
    created as such.  Using `--user` installs python modules into
    ~/.local/lib/PYTHON_VERSION/site-packages.  Making ~/.local a
    virtualenv messes with the paths in site-packages and causes
    runtime errors like this:

        ERROR: Can not perform a '--user' install.
        User site-packages are not visible in this virtualenv.
