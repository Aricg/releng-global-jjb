    Change the comment-added-contains-event strings for the release-verify and
    release-merge templates to the same regexes used in other verify and merge
    templates, instead of custom versions that didn't seem to work;
    verify now uses '^Patch Set\s+\d+:\s+(recheck|reverify)\s*$'
    merge now uses  '^Patch Set\s+\d+:\s+remerge\s*$'
