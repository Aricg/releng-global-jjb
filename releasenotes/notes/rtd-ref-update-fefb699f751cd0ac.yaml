    Removes ref-update from rtd-merge jobs which is triggering unnecessary
    jobs to be queued in Jenkins. This ref-update was originally added to
    enable Jenkins to trigger builds when a release tag is pushed to update
    the docs however it's now triggering many unnecessary jobs wasting
    project CI resources.
