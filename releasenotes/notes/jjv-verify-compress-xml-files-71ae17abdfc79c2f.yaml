    Compress and upload all jjb-verify XML files to Nexus, to ease out the IOPs
    on cron jobs that manage the logs on Nexus and optimize job performace by
    ~8 mins. This is because the job generates around ~2.3K XML files (small
    files) which is uploaded to Nexus in every run of jjb-verify. Doing this
    is faster as compared to the Nexus Unpack plugin in the Nexus end unpacking
    the zip file we upload takes longer.
