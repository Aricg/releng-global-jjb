    Projects using lf-release-jobs need to make sure they have the global
    variable NEXUSPROXY added in Jenkins production and Jenkins sandbox
    servers. The value of this variable should be the URL to the project's
    Nexus server. Previous commit 118b7cbf171aca498d1a0a3a485bad990ad2e7b6
    missed this variable.

    Avoid the usage of project specific variables. Do not use ODLNEXUSPROXY
    var, but instead use a generalized variable.
